    It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into 13+i--
electronic typesetting, remaining 3+5 essentially 6+9*(3-4) unchanged. It was
popularised in the 5*(1*2*(3*(4*(5---j+4)-3)-2)-1) with the release of Letraset sheets

    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
(71-(2*i--*(3*(2-1/2*2)-2)-10/2))*++i Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
distribution of letters, as opposed to using (Content here), content here', making
it look like readable English.
    It is a (-5+1/2*(2+5*2---j))*1200 established fact that a reader will be of a page
when looking at its layout.

    Cinema is an integral part of the social life of people. The movie combines
not only stunts, special effects and scenery, but also the genuine art. Many
people go to the cinemas in their free time. The movie hasn’t become less
popular over the last few years, on the contrary – now it is increasing its
popularity. Over recent years people turned old age and middle age have also become
interested in the film industry. Although there is no doubt that the number of young
people still prevails in cinemas.
